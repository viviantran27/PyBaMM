# [Unreleased](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)

## Features

-   Added fuzzy string matching for parameters and variables ([#796](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/796))
-   Changed ParameterValues to raise an error when a parameter that wasn't previously defined is updated ([#796](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/796))
-   Added some basic models (BasicSPM and BasicDFN) in order to clearly demonstrate the PyBaMM model structure for battery models ([#795](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/795))
-   Added the harmonic mean to the Finite Volume method, which is now used when computing fluxes ([#783](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/783))
-   Refactored `Solution` to make it a dictionary that contains all of the solution variables. This automatically creates `ProcessedVariable` objects when required, so that the solution can be obtained much more easily. ([#781](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/781))
-   Added notebook to explain broadcasts ([#776](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/776))
-   Added a step to discretisation that automatically compute the inverse of the mass matrix of the differential part of the problem so that the underlying DAEs can be provided in semi-explicit form, as required by the CasADi solver ([#769](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/769))
-   Added the gradient operation for the Finite Element Method ([#767](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/767))
-   Added `InputParameter` node for quickly changing parameter values ([#752](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/752))
-   Added submodels for operating modes other than current-controlled ([#751](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/751))
-   Changed finite volume discretisation to use exact values provided by Neumann boundary conditions when computing the gradient instead of adding ghost nodes([#748](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/748))
-   Added optional R(x) distribution in particle models ([#745](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/745))
-   Generalized importing of external variables ([#728](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/728))

-   Added submodels for tortuosity ([#726](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/726))
-   Simplified the interface for setting current functions ([#723](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/723))

This makes the SUNDIALS DAE solvers (Scikits and KLU) truly optional (though IDA KLU is recommended for solving the DFN).
-   Added option to use CasADi's Algorithmic Differentiation framework to calculate Jacobians ([#687](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/687))
-   Added method to evaluate parameters more easily ([#669](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/669))
-   Added `Jacobian` class to reuse known Jacobians of expressions ([#665](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/670))
-   Added `Interpolant` class to interpolate experimental data (e.g. OCP curves) ([#661](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/661))
-   Added interface (via pybind11) to sundials with the IDA KLU sparse linear solver ([#657](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/657))
-   Allowed parameters to be set by material or by specifying a particular paper ([#647](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/647))
-   Set relative and absolute tolerances independently in solvers ([#645](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/645))
-   Added basic method to allow (a part of) the State Vector to be updated with results obtained from another solution or package ([#624](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/624))
-   Added some non-uniform meshes in 1D and 2D ([#617](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/617))

## Optimizations

-   Added caching for shape evaluation, used during discretisation ([#780](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/780))
-   Added an option to skip model checks during discretisation, which could be slow for large models ([#739](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/739))
-   Use CasADi's automatic differentation algorithms by default when solving a model ([#714](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/714))
-   Avoid re-checking size when making a copy of an `Index` object ([#656](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/656))
-   Avoid recalculating `_evaluation_array` when making a copy of a `StateVector` object ([#653](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/653))

## Bug fixes

-   Improved implementation of broadcasts ([#776](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/776))
-   Fixed a bug which meant that the Ohmic heating in the current collectors was incorrect if using the Finite Element Method ([#767](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/767))
-   Improved automatic broadcasting ([#747](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/747))
-   Fixed bug with wrong temperature in initial conditions ([#737](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/737))
-   Improved flexibility of parameter values so that parameters (such as diffusivity or current) can be set as functions or scalars ([#723](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/723))
-   Fixed a bug where boundary conditions were sometimes handled incorrectly in 1+1D models ([#713](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/713))
-   Corrected a sign error in Dirichlet boundary conditions in the Finite Element Method ([#706](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/706))
-   Passed the correct dimensional temperature to open circuit potential ([#702](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/702))
-   Added missing temperature dependence in electrolyte and interface submodels ([#698](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/698))
-   Fixed differentiation of functions that have more than one argument ([#687](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/687))
-   Added warning if `ProcessedVariable` is called outside its interpolation range ([#681](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/681))
-   Improved the way `ProcessedVariable` objects are created in higher dimensions ([#581](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/581))

## Breaking changes

-   Removed `Outer` and `Kron` nodes as no longer used ([#777](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/777))
-   Moved `results` to separate repositories ([#761](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/761))
-   The parameters "Bruggeman coefficient" must now be specified separately as "Bruggeman coefficient (electrolyte)" and "Bruggeman coefficient (electrode)"
-   The current classes (`GetConstantCurrent`, `GetUserCurrent` and `GetUserData`) have now been removed. Please refer to the [`change-input-current` notebook](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/blob/master/examples/notebooks/change-input-current.ipynb) for information on how to specify an input current
-   Parameter functions must now use pybamm functions instead of numpy functions (e.g. `pybamm.exp` instead of `numpy.exp`), as these are then used to construct the expression tree directly. Generally, pybamm syntax follows numpy syntax; please get in touch if a function you need is missing.
-   The current must now be updated by changing "Current function [A]" or "C-rate" instead of "Typical current [A]"
