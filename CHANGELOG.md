## Breaking changes

-   For variables discretised using finite elements the result returned by calling `ProcessedVariable` is now transposed ([#1020](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1020))

-   The current must now be updated by changing "Current function [A]" or "C-rate" instead of "Typical current [A]"
