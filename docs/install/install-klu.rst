PyBaMM developer install - The KLU sparse solver
================================================

If you wish to try a different DAE solver, PyBaMM currently offers a
direct interface to the sparse KLU solver within Sundials. This solver
comes as a C++ python extension module. Therefore, when installing
PyBaMM from source (e.g. from the GitHub repository), the KLU sparse
solver module must be compiled. Running ``pip install .`` or
``python setup.py install`` in the PyBaMM directory will result in a
attempt to compile the KLU module.

Note that if CMake of pybind11 are not found (see below), the
installation of PyBaMM will carry on, however skipping the compilation
of the ``idaklu`` module. This allows developers that are not interested
in the KLU module to install PyBaMM from source without having to
install the required dependencies.

To build the KLU solver, the following dependencies are required:

-  A C++ compiler (e.g. ``g++``)
-  A Fortran compiler (e.g. ``gfortran``)
-  The python 3 header files
-  `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__
-  A BLAS implementation (e.g. `openblas <https://www.openblas.net/>`__)
-  `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`__
-  `sundials <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials>`__
-  `SuiteSparse <http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html>`__

The first four should be available through your favourite package
manager. On Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions:

.. code:: bash

   apt update
   apt install python3-dev gcc gfortran cmake libopenblas-dev

pybind11
--------

The pybind11 source directory should be located in the PyBaMM project
directory at the time of compilation. Simply clone the GitHub
repository, for example:

.. code:: bash

   # In the PyBaMM project dir (next to setup.py)
   git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git

SuiteSparse and sundials
------------------------

Method 1 - Using the convenience script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PyBaMM repository contains a script
``scripts/setup_KLU_module_build.py`` that automatically downloads,
extracts, compiles and installs the two libraries.

First install the Python ``wget`` module

::

   pip install wget

Then execute the script

::

   # In the PyBaMM project dir (next to setup.py)
   python scripts/setup_KLU_module_build.py

The above will install the required component of SuiteSparse and
Sundials in your home directory under ``~/.local/``. Note that you can
provide the option ``--install-dir=<install/path>`` to install both
libraries to an alternative location. If ``<install/path>`` is not
absolute, it will be interpreted as relative to the PyBaMM project
directory.

Finally, reactivate your virtual environment by running

::

   source $(VIRTUAL_ENV)/bin/activate

Alternatively, you update the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable
as follows

::

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(HOME)/.local:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above export statement will be ran automatically the next time you
activate you python virtual environment.

If did not run the convenience script inside a python virtual
environment, execute you bash config file

::

   source ~/.bashrc

(or start a new shell).

Build files are located inside the PyBaMM project directory under
``KLU_module_deps/``. Feel free to remove this directory once everything
is installed correctly.

Method 2 - Compiling Sundials (advanced)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SuiteSparse
^^^^^^^^^^^

On most current linux distributions and macOS, a recent enough version
of the suitesparse source package is available through the package
manager. For instance on Fedora

::

   yum install libsuitesparse-dev

Sundials
^^^^^^^^

The PyBaMM KLU solver requires Sundials >= 4.0. Because most Linux
distribution provide older versions through their respective package
manager, it is recommended to build and install Sundials manually.

First, download and extract the sundials 5.0.0 source

::

   wget https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/download/sundials-5.0.0.tar.gz .
   tar -xvf sundials-5.0.0.tar.gz

Then, create a temporary build directory and navigate into it

::

   mkdir build_sundials
   cd build_sundials

You can now configure the build, by running

::

   cmake -DLAPACK_ENABLE=ON\
         -DSUNDIALS_INDEX_SIZE=32\
         -DBUILD_ARKODE=OFF\
         -DBUILD_CVODE=OFF\
         -DBUILD_CVODES=OFF\
         -DBUILD_IDAS=OFF\
         -DBUILD_KINSOL=OFF\
         -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE:BOOL=OFF\
         -DKLU_ENABLE=ON\
         -DKLU_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/suitesparse/headers\
         -DKLU_LIBRARY_DIR=path/to/suitesparse/libraries\
         ../sundials-5.0.0

Be careful set the two variables ``KLU_INCLUDE_DIR`` and
``KLU_LIBRARY_DIR`` to the correct installation location of the
SuiteSparse libary on your system. If you installed SuiteSparse through
your package manager, this is likely to be something similar to:

::

   -DKLU_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/suitesparse\
   -DKLU_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\

By default, Sundials will be installed on your system under
``/usr/local`` (this varies depending on the distribution). Should you
wish to install sundials in a specific location, set the following
variable

::

   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install/location\

Finally, build the library:

::

   make install

You may be asked to run this command as a super-user, depending on the
installation location.

Alternative installation location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, it is assumed that the SuiteSparse and Sundials libraries
are installed in your home directory under ``~/.local``. If you
installed the libraries to (a) different location(s), you must set the
options ``suitesparse-root`` or/and ``sundials-root`` when installing
PyBaMM. Examples:

::

   python setup.py install --suitesparse-root=path/to/suitesparse

or

::

   pip install . --install-option="--sundials-root=path/to/sundials"

(re)Install PyBaMM to build the KLU solver
------------------------------------------

If the above dependencies are correctly installed, any of the following
commands will install PyBaMM with the ``idaklu`` solver module:

::

   pip install .
   pip install -e .
   python setup.py install
   python setup.py develop
   ...

Note that it doesn’t matter if pybamm is already installed. The above
commands will update your exisitng installation by adding the ``idaklu``
module.

Check that the solver is correctly installed
--------------------------------------------

If you install PyBaMM in `editable
mode <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`__
using the ``-e`` pip switch or if you use the
``python setup.py install`` command, a log file will be located in the
project directory (next to the ``setup.py`` file).

::

   cat setup.log
   020-03-24 11:33:50,645 - PyBaMM setup - INFO - Starting PyBaMM setup
   2020-03-24 11:33:50,653 - PyBaMM setup - INFO - Not running on windows
   2020-03-24 11:33:50,654 - PyBaMM setup - INFO - Could not find CMake. Skipping compilation of KLU module.
   2020-03-24 11:33:50,655 - PyBaMM setup - INFO - Could not find pybind11 directory (/io/pybind11). Skipping compilation of KLU module.

If the KLU sparse solver is correctly installed, then the following
command should return ``True``.

::

   $ python -c "import pybamm; print(pybamm.have_idaklu())"
