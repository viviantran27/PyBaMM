    "# Expression trees in PyBaMM\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic data structure that PyBaMM uses to express models is an expression tree. This data structure encodes a tree representation of a given equation. The expression tree is used to encode the equations of both the original symbolic model, and the discretised equations of that model. Once discretised, the model equations are then passed to the solver, which must then evaluate the discretised expression trees in order to perform the time-stepping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression tree must therefore satisfy three requirements:\n",
    "1. To encode the model equations, it must be able to encode an arbitrary equation, including unary and binary operators such as `*`, `-`, spatial gradients or divergence, symbolic parameters, scalar, matrices and vectors.\n",
    "2. To perform the time-stepping, it must be able to be evaluated, given the current state vector $\\mathbf{y}$ and the current time $t$\n",
    "3. For solvers that require it, its gradient with respect to a given variable must be able to be evaluated (once again given $\\mathbf{y}$ and $t$)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an initial example, the code below shows how to construct an expression tree of the equation $2y(1 - y) + t$. We use the `pybamm.StateVector` to represent $\\mathbf{y}$, which in this case will be a vector of size 1. The time variable $t$ is already provided by PyBaMM and is of class `pybamm.Time`."
