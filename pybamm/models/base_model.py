class BaseModel(object):
    """Base model class for other models to extend.

    Attributes
    ----------

    name: str
        A string giving the name of the model
    options: dict
        A dictionary of options to be passed to the model
    rhs: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the rhs
    algebraic: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the algebraic equations. The algebraic expressions are assumed to equate
        to zero. Note that all the variables in the model must exist in the keys of
        `rhs` or `algebraic`.
    initial_conditions: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the initial conditions for the state variables y. The initial conditions for
        algebraic variables are provided as initial guesses to a root finding algorithm
        that calculates consistent initial conditions.
    boundary_conditions: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the boundary conditions
    variables: dict
        A dictionary that maps strings to expressions that represent
        the useful variables
    events: list
        A list of events that should cause the solver to terminate (e.g. concentration
        goes negative)
    concatenated_rhs : :class:`pybamm.Concatenation`
        After discretisation, contains the expressions representing the rhs equations
        concatenated into a single expression
    concatenated_algebraic : :class:`pybamm.Concatenation`
        After discretisation, contains the expressions representing the algebraic
        equations concatenated into a single expression
    concatenated_initial_conditions : :class:`numpy.array`
        After discretisation, contains the vector of initial conditions
    mass_matrix : :class:`pybamm.Matrix`
        After discretisation, contains the mass matrix for the model. This is computed
        automatically
    jacobian : :class:`pybamm.Concatenation`
        Contains the Jacobian for the model. If model.use_jacobian is True, the
        Jacobian is computed automatically during solver set up
    jacobian_rhs : :class:`pybamm.Concatenation`
        Contains the Jacobian for the part of the model which contains time derivatives.
        If model.use_jacobian is True, the Jacobian is computed automatically during
        solver set up
    jacobian_algebraic : :class:`pybamm.Concatenation`
        Contains the Jacobian for the algebraic part of the model. This may be used
        by the solver when calculating consistent initial conditions. If
        model.use_jacobian is True, the Jacobian is computed automatically during
        solver set up
    use_jacobian : bool
        Whether to use the Jacobian when solving the model (default is True)
    use_simplify : bool
        Whether to simplify the expression tress representing the rhs and
        algebraic equations, Jacobain (if using) and events, before solving the
        model (default is True)
    convert_to_format : str
        Whether to convert the expression trees representing the rhs and
        algebraic equations, Jacobain (if using) and events into a different format:

        - None: keep PyBaMM expression tree structure.
        - "python": convert into pure python code that will calculate the result of \
        calling `evaluate(t, y)` on the given expression treeself.
        - "casadi": convert into CasADi expression tree, which then uses CasADi's \
        algorithm to calculate the Jacobian.

        Default is "python".
